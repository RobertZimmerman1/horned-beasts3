# Horned Beasts

This project was build to attempt to learn how to use components within React, to build a website that shows three cards on a website with individual, unique properties. Props was used within the components to pass information from the parent component to the children components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
